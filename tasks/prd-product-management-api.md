## Introduction/Overview

The Product Management API is a core backend system for the StockEase platform that provides comprehensive inventory management capabilities through REST endpoints. This feature addresses the critical need for automated inventory tracking, smart product search, and scalable business growth through tier-based subscription models. The API serves as the foundation for all product-related operations, enabling users to efficiently manage their inventory while providing clear value differentiation between free and premium tiers.

**Problem Statement**: Users currently face challenges with manual inventory tracking, difficulty finding products quickly, no automated stock alerts, and limited scalability when their business grows.

**Solution**: A comprehensive REST API with smart search capabilities, tier-based access control, and automated inventory management features that scale with business needs.

## Goals

1. **Core Functionality**: Provide complete CRUD operations for product management with real-time tier validation
2. **Smart Search**: Implement intelligent product discovery using master database integration and popularity scoring
3. **Tier Management**: Enforce subscription-based limits (Free: 50 products/20 categories, Premium: Unlimited)
4. **Performance**: Ensure API response times under 1 second with search operations completing within 500ms
5. **Security**: Maintain complete data isolation between users with comprehensive audit logging
6. **Scalability**: Support up to 1000 concurrent users with horizontal scaling capabilities
7. **User Experience**: Provide clear upgrade prompts and tier status information in all API responses

## User Stories

### **As a Store Owner**

- I want to add new products to my inventory so that I can track what I'm selling
- I want to search for products quickly using names, SKUs, or barcodes so that I can find items efficiently
- I want to see my current product count and tier limits so that I know when to upgrade
- I want to organize products by categories so that I can manage my inventory systematically

### **As a Store Staff Member**

- I want to update product stock levels in real-time so that inventory counts are always accurate
- I want to search for products using partial names so that I can help customers quickly
- I want to see product suggestions from the master database so that I can add popular items

### **As a Premium User**

- I want unlimited product management so that my business can grow without constraints
- I want advanced analytics on my products so that I can make data-driven decisions
- I want to export my product data so that I can perform external analysis

## Functional Requirements

### **1. Product CRUD Operations**

- The system must allow users to create new products with required fields (name, unit, current_stock, selling_price)
- The system must auto-generate SKU in format "SKU-YYYYMMDD-XXX" where XXX is daily counter
- The system must allow users to update product information including stock levels
- The system must allow users to delete products (soft delete with is_active flag)
- The system must retrieve products with pagination support (cursor-based)

### **2. Smart Search & Discovery**

- The system must provide full-text search across product names, descriptions, and search tags
- The system must integrate with product_master database for enhanced search suggestions
- The system must support SKU and barcode exact matching
- The system must filter products by category with real-time validation
- The system must return search results ranked by relevance and popularity

### **3. Tier Management & Validation**

- The system must enforce Free tier limits: maximum 50 products and 20 categories per user
- The system must provide Premium tier unlimited access to products and categories
- The system must track real-time usage through user_tier_features table updates
- The system must block new product creation when tier limits are exceeded
- The system must provide clear upgrade prompts with benefit explanations

### **4. Category Management**

- The system must allow users to create, update, and delete product categories
- The system must enforce category limits based on user subscription tier
- The system must prevent category deletion when products are assigned
- The system must provide category hierarchy support for future extensibility

### **5. Data Isolation & Security**

- The system must ensure users can only access their own products
- The system must implement JWT authentication for all endpoints
- The system must log all CRUD operations with user_id, action, timestamp, and IP address
- The system must validate user permissions before any data modification

### **6. API Response Standards**

- The system must return consistent JSON format with status, message, and data structure
- The system must include tier status information in relevant responses
- The system must provide detailed error messages with error_code field
- The system must support cursor-based pagination for large datasets

### **7. Performance & Caching**

- The system must respond to API calls within 1 second for most operations
- The system must complete search operations within 500ms
- The system must implement Redis caching for user tier status and popular products
- The system must use proper database indexing for search performance

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Bulk Operations**: Initial implementation will not include bulk import/export features
- **Image Management**: Product image handling will be implemented in a separate feature
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed product performance analytics are reserved for Premium tier
- **Webhook Notifications**: Real-time notifications will be handled by separate notification service
- **Multi-language Support**: Initial implementation will be Indonesian-focused only
- **Mobile App**: This API is backend-only; mobile integration will be separate

## Design Considerations

### **Database Schema**

- Leverage existing `products` and `product_master` tables with proper indexing
- Use `user_tier_features` table for real-time tier validation
- Implement soft delete pattern for data integrity
- Use GIN indexes for full-text search capabilities

### **API Architecture**

- Follow RESTful principles with consistent endpoint naming
- Implement middleware chain: authentication → tier validation → rate limiting → audit logging
- Use resource-based routing structure (`/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/categories`)
- Support both JSON and form-data for product creation/updates

### **Response Format**

```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "data": {},
  "tier_info": {
    "current_tier": "free|premium",
    "usage": {},
    "limits": {},
    "upgrade_prompt": "string"
  },
  "pagination": {
    "cursor": "string",
    "has_more": "boolean"
  }
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### **Dependencies**

- Integrate with existing JWT authentication middleware
- Use existing tier validation middleware and services
- Leverage current database connection and migration system
- Implement Redis caching for performance optimization

### **Performance Requirements**

- Database queries must use proper indexing (user_id, name, sku, search_tags)
- Search operations must utilize full-text search capabilities
- Implement connection pooling for database scalability
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data

### **Security Measures**

- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

### **Error Handling**

- Standard HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Detailed error messages with error codes
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages for tier limit violations

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 95% of API calls respond within 1 second
2. **Search Performance**: 90% of search operations complete within 500ms
3. **User Adoption**: 80% of users successfully create their first product within 5 minutes
4. **Tier Conversion**: 15% of Free users upgrade to Premium within 30 days
5. **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
6. **Data Integrity**: Zero data leakage between users

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting**: What should be the specific rate limits for different user tiers?
2. **Search Ranking**: How should we weight different factors in search result ranking?
3. **Cache Invalidation**: What's the optimal TTL for cached tier status and popular products?
4. **Audit Retention**: How long should we retain audit logs for compliance purposes?
5. **Future Extensibility**: What additional product attributes might be needed for future features?
